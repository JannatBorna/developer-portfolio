          <P>My personal definition of a professional developer is a developer who is able to build and maintain a commercial piece
        of software. In other words, if said developer made or edited software, and that software is generating money for
        someone somewhere even indirectly.</P>

          <p>The corporate world can be very daunting or very demanding, especially when you are a fresher. From a comparatively
        plain sailing journey of a college/university life to a highly competitive working environment, the transition is never
        easy. Yet I can tell you that getting into the battleground is damn exciting. </p>
