          <h2>Become a web developer</h2>
          <p>My dream life is to become aware. My dream life is to be able to cry, breakdown with no reason and not be judged by the
        people I trust. My dream life is to be unconditionally loved by my close ones. My dream life is to spend as much quality
        time as I can with my family.</p>
