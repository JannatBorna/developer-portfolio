      <h2>Chef is an Interesting Profession</h2>
       <p>Cooking is something that makes me happy and I love cooking for others. I always wanted to be a chef and I really worked
    hard. It is a very nice profession where you can learn new things daily. When I serve a bowl of a recipe, it contains my
    love, hard work, and passion for my profession. I have brought here some essays on the different aspects of being a
    chef. Hope you will like it and will be helpful for you.</p>

            <h2> WHAT DOES A CHEF DO?</h2> 
              <P>A chef is responsible for preparing and cooking food and    provides leadership for the kitchen staff. Chefs will maintain
              relationships with vendors and might be in charge of ordering the restaurant's weekly food supply. They might create new
              menu items and work with the general manager to set business goals.</P>

     <p>The corporate world can be very daunting or very demanding, especially when you are a fresher. From a comparatively
    plain sailing journey of a college/university life to a highly competitive working environment, the transition is never
    easy. Yet I can tell you that getting into the battleground is damn exciting.</p>
